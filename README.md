# WASP-17b Alderson et al. 2022 Paper Files & Figures

All the relevant information needed to make important figures in the paper, plus the various models / spectra / light curves etc that might be relevant for future use

If you're after a specific part of one of the paper figures (e.g., the raw spectroscopic light curve data), I recommend you check out the **retrieval_plots** and **paper_plots** notebooks to see which files are being read in where. 

Of particular relevance might be:
  - **W17_transmission_spectrum.txt** : the full 0.3â€“5 micron transmission spectrum
  - **WASP17b_4000atmo_deckhaze-.txt** : POSEIDON Retrieval Model A
  - **WASP17b_4000atmo_2EB-.txt** : POSEIDON Retrieval Model B
  - **WASP17b_4000chem_species5-.txt** : POSEIDON Retrieval Model C
  - **poseidon_config_W17_paper.py** : The config file used to inform the POSEIDON retrievals in Jul-Nov 2021
  - **atmo.txt** : ATMO Retrieval Model
